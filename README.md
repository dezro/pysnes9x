# pysnes9x
Ancient project in which I crammed Python into SNES9x. It's very unfinished, but I managed some weird things like mouse control in Super Mario World. I wouldn't bother trying to get it to work today, I doubt I accomplished more than what the modern, Lua-based scriptable emulators can do.
